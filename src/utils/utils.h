/**
 *  A UDP "Connection" consists of the IP (for easy printing), the port (for easy printing), the socket fd (so it can be used), 
 * and the sockaddr_in for actually sending stuff. Its not actually a connection as this is UDP, but I am calling it a connection because it has all the
 * makings of one without it actually being connected.
 * @param ip the ip that you are connecting to, space for full "AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD\x00"
 * @param port the port you want to send UDP packets to.
 * @param fd the file descriptor connected to the socket
 * @param s_addr the socket address that you be sending packets to.
 * @param secret 256 bit shared secret key created by the diffie hellman process when establishing a "connection" between two hosts.

/**
 * Config struct holds all the global configuration options.
 * This config file is passed into every major function, 
 * where it will sit to be used should it be neccesary
 * 
 * @param _DEBUG should debug statements be printed, this can be enabled by using -v or --verbose. False by default
 * @param _FUNCLIST print off the function and arguments for each function as it is called. False by default
 * @param _CLEANUP cleans up the arp table upon completion of the session. True by default
 * @param _SHUFFLE should the host shuffle it's MAC addresses? (Mostly debug). Turning _SHUFFLE off will allow it to run in any network configuration (with dhcp).
 * @param _CSTMSEED a custom seed for MAC address shuffling, suggested if using unencrypted. Default is -1 which signifies no custom seed has been set.
 * @param _ENCRYPT determines if the message should be encrypted using AES, true by default, turning off increases program speed.
 * @param _LOG_SYS if true, any debug based statements will be sent to a log file instead
 * @param _OUTPUT_FD fd of where the received output goes.
 * @param _DB_OUTPUT_FD fd of where debug output goes.
 * @param _IFACE the interface to run this on
